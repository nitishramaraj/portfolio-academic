Sell-Easy an innovative platform developed to facilitate the buying and selling of pre-owned items within the campus community. With a focus on sustainability and affordability, Sell-Easy provides students with a convenient way to exchange their old belongings, ranging from textbooks and electronics to clothing and furniture.

The platform offers a user-friendly interface where students can create listings for items they no longer need, set their own prices, and connect with potential buyers within the campus network. By leveraging the power of peer-to-peer transactions, Sell-Easy aims to reduce waste, promote resourcefulness, and foster a sense of community among students.
