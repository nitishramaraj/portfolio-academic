Counsailia is an AI-driven counseling service designed to connect students with counselors who are their seniors or individuals who have walked a similar path. It starts with a comprehensive questionnaire that tracks students' interests and assesses their current standing. Our algorithm then analyzes this data to create tailored pathways for their interests, allowing students to explore specific fields. For additional support, we connect students with experienced senior peers, providing personalized guidance.

These senior students received a fee for their counseling services. Especially post-pandemic, when many students struggled to connect with seniors due to online education, Counsailia has been instrumental in bridging this gap. Developed with the goal of helping students choose the right path, Counsailia empowers students by providing targeted advice and mentorship.
