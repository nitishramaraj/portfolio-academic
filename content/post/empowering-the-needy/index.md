## "The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others."

-Mahatma Gandhi

I spent time teaching students from 5th to 10th grade at a government school in Arani, Tamilnadu, focusing on helping them prepare for their board exams. During my visit, I taught Maths, Science, and English, ensuring the lessons were easy to understand. Many of the students struggled with their studies, but with patience and simple explanations, they started to improve. I used real-life examples to make the subjects more interesting and engaging. It was rewarding to see the students gain confidence and perform better in their exams.

To make the experience more enjoyable, I conducted fun interactive sessions to build a friendly rapport. Through conversations, I learned about their challenges, such as financial problems, lack of academic support, and various family issues. This made me realize how difficult it was for them to study. To help in my small way, I distributed stationery to all the students in the class. Overall, it was a fun and educational experience for both the students and me, and I learned a lot through the process
