abstract: "The efficient functioning of public transportation 
systems is pivotal for societal connectivity and economic 
progress, as they serve as lifelines for commuting and mobility. 
However, the dependency on manual ticketing processes often 
leads to bottlenecks and inefficiencies, hindering smooth 
operations and customer satisfaction. Our work focuses on 
developing an Automated Ticketing System for public 
transportation, utilizing Computer Vision and Neural 
Networks. Through the incorporation of Neural Architecture 
Search and the integration of Deep Sort, a Deep Learning-based 
object tracking model, we aim to enhance system efficiency. Our 
study demonstrates promising results, indicating the potential 
for streamlined ticketing processes in public transportation. "
