abstract: "Data preprocessing is a critical component of data 
science, involving the transformation of raw data into a format 
suitable for analysis. This project introduces a user-friendly 
command-line tool designed to expedite data preprocessing 
tasks such as cleaning, encoding, and visualization. By 
optimizing efficiency and automation, the tool empowers data 
scientists to streamline workflows and ensure the integrity of 
their data. Key functionalities include handling missing data, 
resolving inconsistencies, and selecting relevant features. These 
processes contribute to enhancing data quality, improving the 
performance of machine learning models, and facilitating 
informed decision-making. With a focus on technical 
proficiency and usability, this project aims to simplify the 
complexities of data preprocessing, thereby enabling more 
effective analysis and decision-making in data science 
applications."
